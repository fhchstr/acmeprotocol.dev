[{"id":0,"href":"/docs/acme/","title":"The ACME Protocol","section":"Docs","content":" What is ACME ? # Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) is a standardized communication protocol to automate the process of obtaining and renewing digital certificates, and automate the process of proving domain control, which is a prerequisite for obtaining publicly trusted X.509 TLS certificates for web servers.\nWhy use ACME ? # Because it makes HTTPS easy and automatic. ACME enables you to quickly and easily get TLS web server (serverAuth) certificates for your HTTPS websites. ACME eliminates manual hassle and the risk of expired certificates!\nHow much does ACME cost ? # ACME is a standardized protocol, so it cannot \u0026ldquo;cost\u0026rdquo; anything.\nSome publicly trusted ACME CAs (Certificate Authorities) such as Google Trust Services and Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt provide TLS web server certificates for free. Their certificates are secure and a great fit for all websites.\nYou shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to pay for TLS web server certificates, no matter what kind of website you operate. These free Domain Validated (DV) TLS web server certificates provide the same security as paid certificates.\nWhy do some CAs charge money for TLS web server certificates ? # This answer is only about publicly trusted TLS web server certificates. It does not apply to private CAs nor other types of certificates like document/code signing or client authentication certificates.\nShort answer: Because people who do not know better are still willing to pay for TLS web server certificates.\nLong answer: Paying for services related to TLS web server certificates, such as 24/7 support, higher quota limits, or access to monitoring/visualization dashboards, is fair and justified.\nSome CAs offer, and charge for, OV (Organization Validated) or EV (Extended Validation) certificates. Unlike DV (Domain Validated) certificates, which can be issued within seconds in a fully automated manner thanks to ACME, OV and EV certificates require additional validations, which are generally performed by \u0026ldquo;Validation Specialists\u0026rdquo;. These additional manual validations justify the extra costs for OV and EV certificates.\nOV and EV certificates are not more secure than DV certificates. They use the same technology and cryptographic algorithms as DV certificates. Some regulatory frameworks may require the use of OV or EV certificates in certain industries, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t have to comply with such regulations, just use free DV certificates. OV and EV certificates include additional fields and attributes, such as the name, locality, or even the VAT number of the entity that requested the certificate. Even if this additional information was thoroughly validated by the CA, web browsers ignore it. Thus, there is no point in paying extra money for OV or EV certificates.\nHTTPS doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that a site is secure or that the entity that operates it is trustworthy. As noted in this Chromium blog post, HTTPS only guarantees that you are connecting to the site you intended to and that the connection is secure. These are extremely important guarantees that underpin the Internet\u0026rsquo;s security.\nFinally, some CAs charge additional fees to include additional subdomains, domain names, or wildcard domain names in certificates. This is not justified for DV certificates automatically issued using ACME. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall for it. Use free DV certificates instead.\n"}]
