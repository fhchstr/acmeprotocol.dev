[{"id":0,"href":"/docs/acme/","title":"The ACME Protocol","section":"Docs","content":" Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) # What is ACME ? # The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol is a standardized communication protocol to automate the process of obtaining and renewing digital certificates, and the process of proving domain control, which is a prerequisite for obtaining publicly trusted X.509 TLS certificates for web servers.\nWhy use ACME ? # Because it makes HTTPS easy and automatic. ACME enables you to quickly and easily get serverAuth TLS certificates for your HTTPS websites. ACME eliminates manual hassle and the risk of expired certificates!\nHow much does ACME cost ? # ACME is a standardized protocol, so it cannot \u0026ldquo;cost\u0026rdquo; anything. Some publicly trusted ACME CAs (Certificate Authorities) provide website TLS certificates for free. Google Trust Services and Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt are such free publicly trusted ACME CAs.\nFree TLS web server (serverAuth) certificates automatically issued via ACME are secure and great for all websites. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to pay for your TLS web server certificates.\nWhy do some CAs charge money for TLS web server certificates ? # This answer is only about publicly trusted TLS web server certificates. It does not apply to private CAs nor other types of certificates like document/code signing or client authentication certificates.\nShort answer: Because people, who do not know better, are still willing to pay for it.\nLong answer: Paying for services related to TLS web server certificates, like 24/7 support, higher quota limits, or access to monitoring/visualization dashboards, is fair. But there is no reason to pay for the certificates themselves.\nSome CAs will charge you more for OV (Organization Validated) or EV (Extended Validation) certificates, which require additional non-automatable / manual validations prior issuance compared to DV (Domain Validated) certificates, which can be issued within seconds in a fully automated manner thanks to ACME.\nOV and EV certificates are not more secure than DV certificates. Some regulatory frameworks may require the use of OV or EV certificates in certain industries. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have to comply with such rules, just use free DV certificates.\nHTTPS doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that a site is secure. HTTPS only guarantees that the connection is secure.
