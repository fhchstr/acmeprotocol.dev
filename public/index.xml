 Getting Started with ACME

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>To use &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/acme/">ACME&lt;/a> to automatically manage your certificates, you need to
choose a client and a CA (Certificate Authority). Your choice will depend on
your constraints and requirements. This page provides questions to ask yourself
to aid your selection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before going any further, remember that
&lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/#:~:text=the%20best%20way%20to%20manage%20certificates%20is%20to%20have%20someone%20else%20do%20it%20for%20you">the best way to manage certificates is to have someone else do it for you&lt;/a>
(if your setup allows it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When implementing ACME, follow the guidance from the
&lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/">Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt integration guide&lt;/a>.
Most of their recommendations aren&amp;rsquo;t specific to Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt. They apply to
all ACME integrations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Anatomy of a Certificate</title><link>http://localhost:1313/webpki/cert/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/webpki/cert/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="analogy-with-the-physical-world">

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Digital certificates are like identification documents&lt;/strong> (passport, identity
card, driver license, employee badge, library membership card, retail store
fidelity card, etc.), but for websites. They tie a name to an identity, they
hold additional metadata, they are issued by some (more or less widely
recognized/trusted) entity, and they can be used/accepted in specific
circumstances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digital certificates are issued by CAs (Certificate - or Certification -
Authorities). CAs can either be public or private. Certificates issued by
publicly trusted CAs are trusted/accepted by default by major web browsers and
operating systems (like government-issued passports). Certificate issued by
private CAs are only trusted/accepted by clients who agreed to trust them (like
retail store fidelity cards).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overview</title><link>http://localhost:1313/acme/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/acme/overview/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="acme-overview">
 ACME Overview
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#acme-overview">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>ACME allows clients to trigger certificate management actions using a set of
JSON messages. Issuance using ACME resembles a traditional CA&amp;rsquo;s issuance
process, in which a client:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Creates an account.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Initiates an order for a certificate to be issued.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Proves control of all identifiers (domain names, IP addresses, etc.)
requested to be included in the certificate.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finalizes the order by submitting a CSR (Certificate Signing Request).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Awaits issuance and downloads the issued certificate along with the
corresponding chain(s).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This pages introduces the most important concepts and provides a high-level
explanation of the ACME protocol. Refer to
&lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555">RFC 8555&lt;/a> for additional
information.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Certificate Lifetime</title><link>http://localhost:1313/webpki/cert-lifetime/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/webpki/cert-lifetime/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="certificate-lifetime">
 Certificate Lifetime
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#certificate-lifetime">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The maximal allowed validity of certificates is set by (continuously evolving)
&lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/webpki/">WebPKI&lt;/a> requirements that all publicly trusted CAs must comply with.
Here is the evolution of the maximal allowed validity of TLS web server
certificates.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In 2012, it was set to 60 months (5 years).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2015, it was reduced to 39 months (3 years and 3 months).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2018, it went down to 825 days (a bit more than 2 years).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2021, it was reduced further to 398 days (1 year and 1 month).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2025, a plan
(&lt;a href="https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/pull/553">ballot SC-081&lt;/a>) to
gradually reduce the maximal allowed validity was endorsed by all major web
browsers and most publicly trusted CAs as follows:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In 2026, it will be reduced to 200 days (to allow for a half-yearly renewal
cadence)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2027, it will be reduced to 100 days (to allow for a quarterly renewal
cadence)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2029, it will be reduced to 47 days (to allow for a monthly renewal
cadence)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://pki.goog/">Google Trust Services&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&lt;/a> have always set the maximal validity of
their certificates below 100 days, as shown by
&lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days/">this article published in 2015&lt;/a>

 ACME Challenge Types
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#acme-challenge-types">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>ACME challenges provide the CA with assurance that certificate requesters
control the identifiers (domain name or IP address) requested to be included in
the certificate. To successfully complete challenges, clients must both prove
that they control the identifiers in question and that they hold the private key
of the account key pair used to respond to the challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ACME challenges typically require the client to set up some network accessible
resource that the CA can query (via DNS or HTTP)
&lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/webpki/mpic/">from multiple vantage points worldwide&lt;/a> in order to validate
that the client controls an identifier. Once the challenge is validated, the
client should de-provision the resource.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization)</title><link>http://localhost:1313/webpki/caa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/webpki/caa/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="caa-certificate-authority-authorization">
 CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization)
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#caa-certificate-authority-authorization">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization) is a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types">DNS record type&lt;/a> that
specifies which CAs (Certificate Authorities) are allowed to issue certificates
for a domain name. CAA can also set additional constraints related to
certificate issuances.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/blob/main/docs/BR.md#3228-caa-records">Compliance requirements&lt;/a>
&lt;strong>oblige CAs to honor CAA records&lt;/strong> when issuing certificates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DV (Domain Validated) certificates issued by publicly trusted CAs are all
equally trusted. Browsers treat certificates issued by popular CAs the same way
as certificates issued by small regional CAs. As demonstrated by
&lt;a href="https://unmitigatedrisk.com/?p=673">this article from 2022&lt;/a>, &lt;strong>98% of all
publicly trusted TLS web server certificates are issued by the top 5 CAs&lt;/strong> (out
of 200+ CAs). Current numbers are still in the same ballpark. The vast majority
of publicly trusted TLS web server certificates are issued by a handful of CAs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EAB (External Account Binding)</title><link>http://localhost:1313/acme/eab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/acme/eab/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="eab-external-account-binding">
 EAB (External Account Binding)
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#eab-external-account-binding">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>To enforce quota limits, provide technical support, or prevent abuse, some ACME
CAs may require an existing account in a non-ACME system, such as a CA customer
database, as a prerequisite for creating new ACME accounts. This account
association is called EAB (External Account Binding). It is specified in
&lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.3.4">RFC 8555&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CAs having this requirement advertise it by setting the
&lt;code>meta.externalAccountRequired&lt;/code> field to &lt;code>true&lt;/code> in the JSON object returned by
the &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/acme/overview/#directory">ACME Directory URL&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ARI (ACME Renewal Information)</title><link>http://localhost:1313/acme/ari/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/acme/ari/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="ari-acme-renewal-information">
 ARI (ACME Renewal Information)
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#ari-acme-renewal-information">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>ARI (ACME Renewal Information) is an ACME endpoint that returns, for every
certificate, the suggested period in which they should be renewed. ARI enables
CAs to automatically inform their users that they must proactively replace their
certificates in case they will be revoked due to a compliance violation. In
addition, ARI also helps to mitigate load spikes by evenly distributing the
suggested renewal window across all certificates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MPIC (Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration)</title><link>http://localhost:1313/webpki/mpic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/webpki/mpic/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="mpic-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration">
 MPIC (Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration)
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#mpic-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before issuing certificates, CAs (Certificate Authorities) verify that
requesters control the identifiers (domain name or IP address) requested to be
included. Different &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/acme/challenges/">challenge types&lt;/a> exist to enable
requesters to prove they control an identifier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All these challenge types require the CA to query a network resource via DNS or
HTTP and verify that it holds the expected value. The queries made by the CA may
be performed over unauthenticated channels. This means that &lt;strong>they are
vulnerable to network hijacking attacks&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CT (Certificate Transparency)</title><link>http://localhost:1313/webpki/ct/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/webpki/ct/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="ct-certificate-transparency">
 CT (Certificate Transparency)
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#ct-certificate-transparency">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">Trust, but verify&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;
proverb fits particularly well the WebPKI. Clients trust CAs to only issue
certificates after they&amp;rsquo;ve performed the necessary verifications. But what if
the CA makes a mistake or if someone manipulates the CA into issuing
certificates for a domain you own? &lt;br>
&lt;strong>You would certainly want to know about it, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what CT (Certificate Transparency) is for! Publicly trusted CAs
are obliged to submit all certificates they issue to CT logs, which are
cryptographically verifiable &lt;strong>append-only data stores&lt;/strong> based on
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle trees&lt;/a>, which is the same
technology that underpins the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin cryptocurrency&lt;/a>. This system
works because
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Certificate_Transparency#browser_requirements">most web browsers&lt;/a>
