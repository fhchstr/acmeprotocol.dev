# Getting Started with ACME

To use [ACME](/acme/) to automatically manage your certificates, you need to
choose a client and a CA (Certificate Authority). Your choice will depend on
your constraints and requirements. This page provides questions to ask yourself
to aid your selection.

Before going any further, remember that
[the best way to manage certificates is to have someone else do it for you](/#:~:text=the%20best%20way%20to%20manage%20certificates%20is%20to%20have%20someone%20else%20do%20it%20for%20you)
(if your setup allows it).

When implementing ACME, follow the guidance from the
[Let's Encrypt integration guide](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/).
Most of their recommendations aren't specific to Let's Encrypt. They apply to
all ACME integrations.

## Free Publicly Trusted ACME CAs

It is recommended to use (or to be ready to use) more than one CA to mitigate
the impact of CA outages and forced certificate revocations caused by compliance
violations (which happen, even to the most rigorous CAs).

Depending on your needs, here are questions you may ask yourself to aid your
selection. The answer to some of these questions may change over time and some
answers may not be easily found online.

- What is the SLO/SLA (Service Level Objective/Service Level Agreement) of the
  CA?
- Does the CA provide user support?
- Can the CA issue
  [wildcard certificates](https://www.keyfactor.com/blog/what-is-a-wildcard-certificate/)?
  ([they have drawbacks](https://www.keyfactor.com/blog/what-is-a-wildcard-certificate/#:~:text=Drawbacks%20of%20using%20wildcard%20certificates)!)
- Can the CA issue multi-domain certificates?
  ([they have drawbacks](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-disadvantages-of-multi-domain-SSL-certificates)!)
- Can the CA issue certificates for
  [internationalized domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode)?
- Can the CA issue certificates for IP addresses?
- What rate limits does the CA enforce?
- What [challenge types](/acme/challenges/) does the CA support?
- Does the CA support [ARI (ACME Renewal Information)](/acme/ari/)?
- Does the CA require [EAB (External Account Binding)](/acme/eab/)? If yes, is
  it a problem for you?
- What clients (browsers, command-line utilities, operating systems, embedded
  systems, programming languages, etc.), and which versions, trust the
  certificates issued by the CA?
- What is the
  [security level](https://www.feistyduck.com/library/openssl-cookbook/online/openssl-command-line/understanding-security-levels.html)
  and size of the CA's certificate chains?
- What key types, sizes, and algorithms does the CA support?

Once you've selected the CAs you want to use, make sure to set appropriate
[CAA records](/webpki/caa/) to allow them to issue certificates for your
domains.

## ACME Clients

Refer to https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/ and
https://acmeclients.com/ to find the client that best fits your needs.

Here are questions you may ask yourself to aid your selection. The answer to
some of these questions may change over time and some answers may not be easily
found online.

- Is the client supported on your operating system?
- Is the client integrated with your DNS/hosting provider? (to automatically
  solve ACME challenges)
- Does the client support all challenge types you plan to use?
- Does the client support [EAB (External Account Binding)](/acme/eab/)?
- Does the client support [ARI (ACME Renewal Information)](/acme/ari/)?
- Is the client popular/actively maintained?
