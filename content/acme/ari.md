# ARI (ACME Renewal Information)

ARI (ACME Renewal Information) is an ACME endpoint that returns, for each
certificate, the suggested period in which they should be renewed. ARI enables
CAs to **automatically** inform their users that they must **proactively
replace** their certificates in case they will be revoked due to, for example, a
compliance requirement violated by the CA. In addition, ARI also helps to
**mitigate load spikes on the CA infrastructure** by evenly distributing the
suggested renewal window across all certificates.

ARI is being standardized in a
[draft RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-ari/). See the
[ARI announcement](https://letsencrypt.org/2023/03/23/improving-resliiency-and-reliability-with-ari/)
and the
[ARI integration guide](https://letsencrypt.org/2024/04/25/guide-to-integrating-ari-into-existing-acme-clients/)
from Let's Encrypt for more information.

## How Does It Work ?

ACME clients generally run at a scheduled interval (e.g. once a day via `cron`).
Without ARI, most ACME client renew their certificates either a fix amount of
time before their `notAfter` expiry timestamp or after some percentage of their
validity period has passed (usually ~70%).

With ARI, ACME clients don't need to implement their own logic to determine when
to renew certificates. Instead, they ask the CA when would be a good time to do
it.

To query the suggested renewal window, clients must send, for each certificate,
an HTTP `GET` request to the `renewalInfo` URL found in the JSON object returned
by the [ACME Directory URL](/acme/overview/#directory). Here is how an ARI
request looks like.

```bash
$ curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/renewal-info/db7Ed66J9kQ3fc-xaB8dGuvcNFk.AnGD1KgleQcKPY9gnifN5Q
```

The path of the request URL ends with the base64url-encoded
[Authority Key ID](/webpki/cert/#authority-key-identifier) and
[Serial Number](/webpki/cert/#serial-number) of the certificate concatenated
with a "`.`" character. Use

## How Often Should Clients Query the ARI Endpoint ?

To ensure timely replacement of certificates affected by upcoming revocations,
clients should query the ARI endpoint multiple times per day.

Cron-based clients should be configured to run every 4-8 hours. Clients with
more flexible scheduling capabilities should honor the
[Retry-After](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Retry-After)
HTTP header set in ARI responses to determine when to send the next request. CAs
may lower its value when they know that a revocation is about to happen.

To ensure that ARI requests aren't silently failing, clients must also ensure
that failures are reported.
