# ACME Overview

ACME allows clients to trigger certificate management actions using a set of
JSON messages. Issuance using ACME resembles a traditional CA's issuance
process, in which a client:

1. Creates an account.
2. Initiates an order for a certificate to be issued.
3. Proves control of all identifiers (domain names, IP addresses, etc.)
   requested to be included in the certificate.
4. Finalizes the order by submitting a CSR (Certificate Signing Request).
5. Awaits issuance and downloads the issued certificate along with the
   corresponding chain(s).

This pages introduces the most important concepts and provides a high-level
explanation of the ACME protocol. Refer to
[RFC 8555](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555) for additional
information.

## Directory URL

Since ACME is a standardized protocol, **any ACME client can request
certificates from any ACME CA** (Certificate Authority). The client only needs
to configure one thing: the **ACME Directory URL**.

The ACME Directory URL returns everything the client needs to know to interact
with the ACME CA. For example, [Google Trust Services](https://pki.goog/)' ACME
Directory URL is `https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/directory`. Here is the
response from an HTTP `GET` request to that URL.

```json
{
  "newNonce": "https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-nonce",
  "newAccount": "https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-account",
  "newOrder": "https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-order",
  "newAuthz": "https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/new-authz",
  "revokeCert": "https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/revoke-cert",
  "keyChange": "https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/key-change",
  "renewalInfo": "https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/renewal-info",
  "meta": {
    "termsOfService": "https://pki.goog/GTS-SA.pdf",
    "website": "https://pki.goog",
    "caaIdentities": ["pki.goog"],
    "externalAccountRequired": true
  }
}
```

The returned JSON object lists URLs for various certificate management actions,
such as creating a new account (`newAccount`) or initiating a new order
(`newOrder`). The JSON object also holds metadata that links to various
resources, specifies the [CAA identities](/webpki/caa/) that the CA recognizes
as referring to itself, and indicates whether
[EAB (External Account Binding)](/acme/eab/) is required for creating an ACME
account.

## Account

Before creating a new ACME account, the client must generate an **asymmetric key
pair**. The client uses the generated ACME account private key to authenticate
themselves by signing all messages sent to the CA. There is no username, the key
pair suffices. See [Request Protection](#request-protection) below.

New ACME accounts are created by sending an HTTP `POST` request to the
`newAccount` URL. The previously generated ACME account public key must be set
in the `jwk`
([JSON Web Key](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.3))
header parameter of the request's
[JWS (JSON Web Signature)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Signature).
The CA will use it to authenticate future requests from that account.

When creating a new account, the client must set `termsOfServiceAgreed` to
`true` in the request to attest that they read and agree to the terms of service
linked from `meta.termsOfService` in the JSON object returned by the ACME
Directory URL.

Clients can also provide a contact URL, usually a `mailto:` email address, that
the CA can use to notify them about upcoming certificates expiries, upcoming
certificate revocations caused by external factors, or
[Certificate Problem Reports](https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/blob/main/docs/BR.md#:~:text=common%20security%20requirements.-,Certificate%20Problem%20Report,-%3A%20Complaint%20of%20suspected)
received by the CA. Note that
[Let's Encrypt stopped sending expiry notification emails in 2025](https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/22/ending-expiration-emails/)
and **ARI** ([ACME Renewal Information](/acme/ari/)) **should be used** instead
to automatically know when certificates should be renewed and proactively renew
them if they are going to be affected by upcoming revocations caused by external
factors.

Finally, if `meta.externalAccountRequired` is `true` in the JSON object returned
by the ACME Directory URL, the `newAccount` request must include the
`externalAccountBinding` field. This is used to associate the ACME account with
an existing account in a non-ACME system, such as a CA customer database. The
value of the `externalAccountBinding` field is described in
[RFC 8555](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.3.4). The
essential point is that its value depends on a MAC (Message Authentication Code)
key and a key identifier, which must both be **previously provided by the CA
using a mechanism outside of ACME**. See
[the page dedicated to External Account Binding](/acme/eab/) for more
information.

## Request Protection

Most ACME requests:

- Must have a JSON body signed using the ACME account private key.
- Must have a "`kid`"
  ([Key ID](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.4)) field
  which references the ACME account URL to which the key is bound.
- Must use the HTTP `POST` method since HTTP `GET` requests can't have a body.
- Must include an unpredictable nonce to protect against replay attacks.
- Must include a "`url`" field (part of the **signed** JSON body) which
  specifies the URL to which the request is directed to protect against
  compromised CDNs (Content Delivery Networks).
- Must have the `Content-Type` HTTP header field set to
  "`application/jose+json`".

These requirements ensure that all requests that must be restricted to only a
specific ACME account are authenticated appropriately. The CA maintains a list
of nonces that it has issued, and it requires any signed request from clients to
carry such a nonce. Clients can get fresh nonces from the `Replay-Nonce` HTTP
header included in all responses from the CA or by sending an HTTP `HEAD`
request to the `newNonce` URL.

To fetch resources (which would otherwise be done using the HTTP `GET` method),
clients must send HTTP `POST` requests with a JWS (JSON Web Signature) body
having the `payload` field set to the empty string (`""`). Such requests are
referred to as "`POST-as-GET`" requests.

There are a few exceptions to these rules. For example, the Directory URL can be
fetched using a simple HTTP `GET` request, or `revokeCert` requests can be
signed using the certificate private key instead of the account private key.

## Order Initiation

New certificate orders are created by sending an HTTP `POST` request to the
`newOrder` URL. The JSON body of the request must include the identifiers
(domain names and IP addresses) that the client wishes to include in the
certificate and, optionally, the `notBefore`/`notAfter` timestamps that
determine the certificate's validity. If they aren't set, the CA sets sane
default values instead. See
[the page dedicated to certificate lifetimes](/webpki/cert-lifetime/) for more
information.

If the CA is willing to issue the requested certificate, it responds with a
`201 (Created)` HTTP status. The JSON body of the response contains the URL of
all authorizations the client must complete before the certificate can be
issued. The client must send `POST-as-GET` requests to the indicated URLs to
fetch detailed information about the authorization resources tied to the order.

See the [Domain Control Validation](#dcv) section below to understand how
authorizations can be completed.

There is another (less common) flow to initiate certificate issuances. It is
called the
"[pre-authorization](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.4.1)"
flow. It consists of first sending an HTTP `POST` request to the `newAuthz` URL
(new authorization) for all identifiers the client wishes to include in the
certificate, then completing all authorizations (see the
[Domain Control Validation](#dcv) section below), and finally initiating a
`newOrder`, without having to reactively complete the corresponding
authorizations since they have all been pre-authorized.

## DCV (Domain Control Validation) {#dcv}

{{% hint info %}}

Domain Control Validation, despite its name, applies to both domain names and IP
addresses.

{{% /hint %}}

An authorization with status "`valid`" signifies that the tied ACME account is
authorized to manage certificates for a given identifier (domain name or IP
address). To complete an authorization, the client must complete the DCV (Domain
Control Validation) process to **prove that they control the identifier** in
question.

Each authorization has multiple associated challenges, each with a
[different type](/acme/challenges/). To complete an authorization, the client
must **solve one of them** (the client gets to choose the one they prefer). The
most common challenge types are `dns-01` and `http-01`. They require the client
to publish a value derived from a token provided by the CA to an agreed upon URL
via DNS or HTTP, respectively. It is assumed that **the value at the agreed upon
URL can only be updated by someone who legitimately controls the identifier**.

The client must send an HTTP `POST` request with an empty JSON body ("`{}`") to
the challenge URL (not the authorization URL) once they are ready for CA to
validate a challenge. Upon receiving this request, the CA retrieves content from
the agreed upon URL (via DNS or HTTP) and verifies that the fetched data matches
the expected value.

To mitigate hijacking attacks, CAs perform the challenge validation from
multiple vantage points worldwide. Refer to
[the page dedicated to MPIC (Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration)](/webpki/mpic/)
for more information.

Usually, the validation process takes some time, so the client needs to
regularly poll the authorization URL to know when it is completed. Once
validated, the authorization can be reused for a limited period of time. This
streamlines future certificate issuances for the same domain name by eliminating
the need for repeated control validation.

## Order Finalization and Issuance {#issuance}

Once all authorizations from an order are "`valid`", the order transitions to
the "`ready`" state. Newly created orders may immediately be in a "`ready`"
state if all their identifiers were previously authorized.

Orders are finalized by sending an HTTP `POST` request to the `finalize` URL
found in the JSON object returned by `newOrder`. This request must only be sent
once all corresponding authorizations have been completed.

The JSON body of the `finalize` request must include a
[CSR (Certificate Signing Request)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request)
for the certificate being requested. The CSR must indicate the exact same set of
identifiers as the initial `newOrder` request. Generally, **the CA only extracts
the public key from the CSR** and ignores all other attributes and extensions.

Before issuing the certificate, **the CA verifies [CAA records](/webpki/caa/)**
to ensure that it is authorized to issue a certificate for the requested
identifiers.

Once all validations pass, the CA issues the certificate including all requested
(and validated) identifiers. To issue the certificate, the CA builds and
populates a data structure called a `tbsCertificate` (to be signed certificate)
and **signs it using an intermediate CA private key**. The `tbsCertificate`
contains the requested identifiers, the public key from the CSR,
`notBefore`/`notAfter` validity timestamps,
[SCTs (Signed Certificate Timestamps)](/webpki/ct/), and other attributes
required to validate the authenticity of the certificate. See
[the page dedicated to the anatomy of certificates](/webpki/cert/) for more
information.

The CA then respond with a `200 (OK)` HTTP status. The JSON body of the response
contains an updated order object having its status set to "`valid`" and a new
"`certificate`" field that holds the URL for downloading the issued certificate.

To download the issued certificate, the client simply sends an HTTP
`POST-as-GET` request to the `certificate` URL with the `Accept` HTTP header set
to "`application/pem-certificate-chain`". The response from the CA is a series
of PEM-encoded certificates, starting with the newly issued certificate,
followed by one or more CA certificates necessary to build the chain, without
including the self-signed root CA certificate (a.k.a. "trust anchor").

{{% /details %}}

[The TLS protocol](https://tls13.xargs.org/#server-certificate) requires servers
to serve certificates which form a chain of trust leading from the TLS web
server certificate to a trust anchor. This is why the site for which the
certificate just got issued must **serve this whole certificate chain to its
visitors** when handling HTTPS connections (and not just the newly issued TLS
web server certificate).

The response from the CA may also include a `Link` HTTP header with
`rel="alternate"` pointing to alternative certificate chains (including
[cross-signed](https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/)
CA certificates) starting with the same TLS web server certificate and ending
with different trust anchors. Clients can fetch these alternate chains and use
their own heuristics (e.g. the lightest, the most compatible, etc.) to decide
which one to serve to visitors of their site.

A `certificate` resource represents a single, immutable certificate. To renew a
certificate, the client must initiate a new order.

Remember that certificates are based on **asymmetric** cryptography.
Certificates only include the public key. **The private key must not be shared
with anyone**, not even the CA who issues the certificate.

## Revocation

Certificates are normally valid between their `notBefore` and `notAfter`
timestamps. There may be (security, business, compliance, etc.) reasons to
invalidate a certificate before its `notAfter` timestamp. This is what
revocation is for.

Certificates can be revoked by sending an HTTP `POST` request to the
`revokeCert` URL. The JSON body of the request must include the certificate to
revoke and can optionally include the desired
[revocation reasonCode](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-5.3.1).

Revocation requests are different from other ACME requests in that they can be
signed with either an account key pair or the key pair in the certificate (in
which case the client doesn't need to have an ACME account registered with the
CA).

There are 3 ways to be authorized to revoke certificates via ACME:

- By signing the revocation request using **the private key of the ACME account
  used to issue the certificate** (in which case the client is assumed to be the
  one who requested the certificate in the first place).
- By signing the revocation request using **the certificate private key** (in
  which case the client is either the one who requested the certificate, or the
  certificate private key is compromised, and it must be revoked anyway).
- By signing the revocation request using the private key of an ACME account
  that holds "`valid`" authorizations for **all the identifiers** in the
  certificate (in which case the client is the legitimate owner of all
  identifiers included in the certificate).
