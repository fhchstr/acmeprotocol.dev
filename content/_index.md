# Automatic HTTPS, for free !

HTTPS is HTTP, but **secure** (thus the extra "S"). HTTPS relies on the TLS
(Transport Layer Security) protocol and **X.509 certificates** to provide
encryption, authentication, and data integrity. HTTPS plays a crucial role in
the Internet's security. It ensures that clients connect to websites they intend
to and that the data transferred to/from these sites is not readable nor
modified by others.

Acquiring TLS web server certificates used to be slow, cumbersome, and
expensive. This isn't the case anymore. \
**Acquiring certificates is now fast, easy, automatic, and free** thanks to the [ACME protocol](/acme/)
and **free TLS web server certificates** offered by publicly trusted ACME CAs (Certificate
Authorities) like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) and [Google Trust Services](https://pki.goog).

HTTPS adoption keeps growing since
[Let's Encrypt became generally available](https://letsencrypt.org/2016/04/12/leaving-beta-new-sponsors/)
in 2016. As shown on
[Google's HTTPS transparency report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview),
**HTTPS is now the norm**. For instance,
[Cloudflare shut down all cleartext HTTP ports](https://blog.cloudflare.com/https-only-for-cloudflare-apis-shutting-the-door-on-cleartext-traffic/)
on `api.cloudflare.com` in 2025.

HTTPS and digital certificates are foundational layers of the Internet. Website
operators shouldn't have to think about it. **HTTPS should be automatically
provisioned for all websites**. Regrettably, too many site operators still
manage their certificates manually. \
**This site provides resources to better understand the WebPKI and automate the lifecycle
management of digital certificates using ACME**, preferably using free DV (Domain
Validated) TLS web server certificates.

If your setup allows it, **the best way to manage certificates is to have
someone else do it for you**! All major cloud providers offer **managed
certificate solutions**, which are integrated in most of their cloud hosting
services. For example:

- [Google Certificate Manager](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs)
  (**Free**)
- [Cloudflare SSL/TLS Certificates](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/ssl/)
  (**Free**)
- [Amazon AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)
  (**Free**)
- [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/certificate-lifecycle/)
  (**Requires payment** of a DigiCert or GlobalSign subscription)

If you're unable to delegate the management of your certificates, see the
[getting started page](/getting-started/) for automating the lifecycle
management of your certificates using [the ACME protocol](/acme/).
